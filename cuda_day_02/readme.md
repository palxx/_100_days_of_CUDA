Day 2: Executed squaring of integer in CUDA and triton in google colab, learnt about triton and how is it simpler version of CUDA and used for automatic memory management whereas in CUDA we will assign memory using cudaMalloc and have more fine grained control over our program when executed on GPU. But i dont really understand how automatic memory management is working in triton.
