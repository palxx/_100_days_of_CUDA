#Brent Kung Algorithm: 
##Poor performance than Kogge Stone we implemented earlier, because it keeps on using more steps than required and utilizes less threads in a warp, as in case of 
kogge stone we are doing redundant work but not fully utilizing all the threads in the block. 
Pretty interesting.
