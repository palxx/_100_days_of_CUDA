ðŸ”¹ Brent-Kung Parallel Prefix Sum Algorithm

	â€¢	Prefix Sum (Scan): Computes cumulative sums efficiently.
	â€¢	Brent-Kung Algorithm: Uses a tree-based approach to perform the scan in O(log N) time.
	â€¢	Two Main Phases:
	â€¢	âœ… Upsweep (Reduction Phase) â†’ Builds a sum tree by summing adjacent values.
	â€¢	âœ… Downsweep (Distribution Phase) â†’ Uses the sum tree to compute prefix sums.

ðŸ”¹ Used cudaGetDeviceProperties() to analyze GPU capabilities. Important GPU features:
 
	â€¢	Max Threads per Block (1024 typical)
	â€¢	Warp Size (32)
	â€¢	Shared Memory per Block (48 KB)
	â€¢	Number of Multiprocessors (SMs)
 	â€¢	Understanding GPU hardware lets you design CUDA kernels that match the architecture.
	â€¢	More SMs = more parallelism.
	â€¢	Optimizing memory access patterns can maximize throughput.
