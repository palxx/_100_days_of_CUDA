Today I studied: DRAM Architecture and how slowness of DRAM Affectes performance. 
First, the DRAM releases capacitor charge when reading a value 
Second, suppose we have DRAM Array, we will request a row (burst) with the help of row decoder
Third, sense amps senses it
Fourth, stores the value in column latch
Fifth, the Mux selects the data we want finally, helpful in case of bursts. 
Accessing Data in the same burst is better than accessing data in different burst.
