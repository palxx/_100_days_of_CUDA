# 🚀 Flash Attention in CUDA - A Fast and Efficient Implementation

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the CUDA-powered Flash Attention implementation! This project explores how attention mechanisms can be efficiently computed on GPUs using shared memory and optimized block-wise operations. If you're into deep learning and high-performance computing, you're in for a treat! 🍕🔥

## 📌 What's Inside?

- **Parallelized Attention Computation**: Uses CUDA kernels to accelerate matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
- **Shared Memory Optimization**: Blocks of queries, keys, and values are loaded into shared memory to reduce costly global memory accesses.
- **Efficient Block Processing**: The attention operation is computed in small blocks, making the process more scalable and memory-efficient.
- **Dynamic Thread Synchronization**: Ensures proper ordering of operations for correctness and speed.

## 📜 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The host allocates memory for queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V), and initializes them with random values.
2. **Device Memory Allocation**: CUDA memory is allocated for all required matrices.
3. **Kernel Execution**: The CUDA kernel (`cuda_day_09`) is launched with appropriate grid and block dimensions.
4. **Shared Memory Utilization**: Query, Key, and Value blocks are loaded into shared memory for fast access.
5. **Attention Computation**:
   - Compute scaled dot-product attention scores.
   - Apply softmax normalization.
   - Multiply attention weights with the Value matrix.
6. **Result Transfer**: The computed attention outputs are copied back from device to host for analysis.

## 🖥️ Running the Code

1. **Compile the CUDA program**:
   ```sh
   nvcc cuda_day_09.cu -o cuda_day_09
   ```
2. **Run the executable**:
   ```sh
   ./cuda_day_09
   ```

## 📊 Expected Output

- The console prints the **Query**, **Key**, **Value**, and **Output** matrices.
- You should see meaningful transformations as attention is applied.

## 🎯 Why Flash Attention?

🔹 **Speed**: By leveraging shared memory and optimized tiling, we reduce global memory latency. 🔹 **Memory Efficiency**: Breaking matrices into blocks prevents memory overflow issues common in deep learning. 🔹 **Scalability**: The approach works well even with longer sequences, making it ideal for large-scale transformer models.

## 🛠️ Customization & Experiments

- Play around with **sequence\_length** and **embedding\_dimension** to see how the execution time changes!
- Modify the **block sizes** to experiment with different memory access patterns.
- Try different **initialization methods** (e.g., real dataset inputs) for a more realistic setup.
