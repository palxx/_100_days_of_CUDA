Today I learnt about matrix addition on triton, CUDA. In CUDA we will load it on GPU, do the calculation and then free up the memory on GPU. It is same process 
as vector additon but just additon function for matrix is a little different. Other than that comapring CPU with GPU performance gave like CPU Execution Time: 1.36273 seconds
CUDA Execution Time: 0.0525025 seconds. CUDA's performance is better.
